      <h2>defination of a triangle</h2>
      <p>a triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. they are grouped according to length of sides and internal angles. in this page we will talk about angles grouped according to side lengths</p>
      <h2>types of a triangle</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>equilateral triangle</li>
        <li>isosceles triangle</li>
        <li>scalene triangle</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Equilateral triangle</h3>
      <p>an equilateral triangle has equal lengths on all sides. A equilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles measuring 60 degrees</p>
      <h3>Isosceles triangle</h3>
      <p>an isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length</p>
      <h3>Scalene triangle</h3>
      <p>a scalene triangle has all its sides of different lengths. equivalently it has all angles of different measure.</p>
